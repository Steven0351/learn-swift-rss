				<![CDATA[<p>Sadly, this will be the last episode of Learn Swift. I want to thank everyone who has listened to the show, because it would not have been around if it wasn&#8217;t for you.

				<![CDATA[<p>On today&#8217;s episode I bring back Greg Szydlo. When Greg first came on the show he was in the early stages of developing his meal planning app and has since gone through several beta and release cycles. We talk about TestFlight, creating UI in code, and releasing to the app store. You will also hear me repeatedly refer to UIViewPropertyAnimator as UIPropertyViewAnimator: apologies if that makes you cringe! Greg is also looking for more beta testers, so if you are interested in helping out reach out to him via one of the methods below!</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meals-food-planner/id1291771889?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Food Planner on the App Store</a><br />
